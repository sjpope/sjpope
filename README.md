## About Me

- 🔭 **Currently Working On**: 
  - **FlowNote** — an AI-Powered Note-Taking App originally built using **Django** and a locally fine-tuned **GPT-2 Medium** transformer. I’m in the process of **restoring** and **refactoring** FlowNote, migrating from BitBucket/Heroku over to GitHub for improved collaboration and visibility.

- 🌱 **Currently Learning**:
  - **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **MLOps**, **Databricks**, **Hadoop**, and other emerging Data Engineering technologies. 
  - I’m always open to conversations around these tools — feel free to ask away.

- 📫 **How to Reach Me**:
  - Email: [sjpope03@gmail.com](mailto:sjpope03@gmail.com)

- 💬 **Ask Me About**:
  - Anything Data-related. I love chatting about data pipelines, cloud solutions, big data platforms, or AI/ML projects.
